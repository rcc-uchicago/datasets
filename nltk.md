# NLTK
Python's Natural Language Toolkit provides a free, open-source platform for natural language processing using python programs to work with human language data. It provides interfaces to many corpora in addition to a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, and an active discussion forum.

NLTK may be useful to research areas relating to natural language processing, computational linguistics, human-computer interaction, machine learning, cognitive science, information retrieval, and artificial intelligence.
