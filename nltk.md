# NLTK
Python's Natural Language Toolkit provides a free, open-source platform for python programs to work with human language data. It provides interfaces to many corpora in addition to a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, and an active discussion forum.

NLTK may be useful to research areas relating to computational linguistics, human-computer interaction, and artificial intelligence.
