# CESM
The Community Earth Science Model (CESM) incorporates data on the physical, chemical, and biological processes of the atmosphere, ocean, and land surface to create a climate model for simulations of past and future climates. RCC provides the CESM input data sets and models.

CESM is useful for research areas related to biogeochemistry, oceanography, ecology, hydrology, atmospheric science, geophysics, and climate system modeling.
