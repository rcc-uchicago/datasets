# PDB
Summary
The Protein Data Bank (PDB), managed by the Worldwide Protein Data Bank, holds data on the 3D structure of large biomolecules (i.e. proteins and nucleic acids) primarily obtained from X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, or electron microscopy. 

PDB is useful to research areas related to structural biology and biochemistry.

Each structure in PDB is given a unique PDB ID, a 4-character identifier. However, each biomolecule may have more than one PDB ID, since each environment or conformation may have a different PDB ID, so PDB IDs do not uniquely identify biomolecules.

Files are in one of the following formats:

    PDB file format
    mmCIF - macromolecular Crystallographic Information file 
    PDBML - an XML version of mmCIF 

Individual files can be downloaded into graphics packages with the following web addresses:

    PDB format: http://www.pdb.org/pdb/files/<PDB_ID>.pdb.gz or http://pdbe.org/download/<PDB_ID>
    PDBML: http://www.pdb.org/pdb/files/<PDB_ID>.xml.gz or http://pdbe.org/pdbml/<PDB_ID>

Files can also be downloaded at the following link:
