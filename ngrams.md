# NGRAMS
The Google Ngram Viewer is an online phrase usage graphing tool, which tracks the yearly count of specific n-grams (letter combinations of n items) or words and phrases. The Ngram database is a Google Books wordsearch database with a corpus of over 500 billion words in American English, British English, French, German, Spanish, Russian, Hebrew, and Chinese. NGRAMS is a complete clone of the Google Ngram dataset.

NGRAMS is useful for research areas related to computational linguistics.
